# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a full-stack application that uses the MEN stack. Users can add campsites with prices, location via Google maps, and a description.

This application taught me a ton about full-stack web development. 
From authenticating users with PassportJS, to learning how to organize and modulize a codebase for easy maintenance. 

I also learned how to implement a MongoDB database to store campsites, comments, and users. 

This project gave me a template on how to build a full-stack web application and I am in the process
of adding updates and new functionalities.
